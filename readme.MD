React Starter Kit

Two years of professional React, here is my ideal stack for a good ratio between quality, production time, maintainability, debugging, testing.

- React with Hooks and lazy loading, no more class
- Redux with redux-thunk
- [Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/), all in one for style 
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), promise based http client
- PropTypes for component typing
